Based on the code I provided previously, here's a breakdown:

1. images/desktop_banner.jpg
Current Name: desktop_banner.jpg

Suggested New Name: No change needed, desktop_banner.jpg is a descriptive and good name for its purpose.

Location: This image should be placed inside a folder named images that is in the same directory as your index.html file. So, the path will be your-project-folder/images/desktop_banner.jpg.

Usage in index.html: This image is used at the very top of your main content area, acting as a header or banner image.

HTML

<section class="mb-12">
    <img src="images/desktop_banner.jpg" alt="Developer Desktop Setup" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl object-cover max-h-96">
</section>
2. images/image1.jpg for Baserow
Current Name: image1.jpg

Suggested New Name: baserow_interface.jpg or baserow_screenshot.jpg

Why? This makes it immediately clear what the image depicts without having to remember that image1 corresponds to Baserow.

Location: This image should be placed inside your images folder. So, the path will be your-project-folder/images/baserow_interface.jpg.

Usage in index.html: This image is used for the Baserow project entry.

HTML

<img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Baserow Database Interface" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto object-cover max-h-72">
If you rename: You would change src="images/image1.jpg" to src="images/baserow_interface.jpg".

3. images/image2.jpg for Plausible Analytics

Suggested New Name: plausible_dashboard.jpg or plausible_analytics_screenshot.jpg

4. images/image3.jpg for NocoDB

HTML

<img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="NocoDB Interface" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto object-cover max-h-72">
If you rename: You would change src="images/image3.jpg" to src="images/nocodb_interface.jpg".

5. images/image4.jpg for Ghost
Current Name: image4.jpg

Suggested New Name: ghost_cms_dashboard.jpg or ghost_publishing.jpg

Why? Describes the content.

Location: This image should be placed inside your images folder.

Usage in index.html: This image is used for the Ghost project entry.

HTML

<img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Ghost CMS Dashboard" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto object-cover max-h-72">
If you rename: You would change src="images/image4.jpg" to src="images/ghost_cms_dashboard.jpg".

6. images/image5.jpg for SuiteCRM
Current Name: image5.jpg

Suggested New Name: suitecrm_dashboard.jpg or crm_overview.jpg

Why? More descriptive.

Location: This image should be placed inside your images folder.

Usage in index.html: This image is used for the SuiteCRM project entry.

HTML

<img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="CRM Dashboard" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto object-cover max-h-72">

7. images/image6.jpg for Outline
Current Name: image6.jpg

Suggested New Name: outline_knowledge_base.jpg or outline_interface.jpg

Why? Clearly identifies the project.

Location: This image should be placed inside your images folder.

Usage in index.html: This image is used for the Outline project entry.

HTML

<img src="images/image6.jpg" alt="Outline Knowledge Base Interface" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto object-cover max-h-72">
If you rename: You would change src="images/image6.jpg" to src="images/outline_knowledge_base.jpg".

In summary, to make your project folder organized and your code more readable:

Create a folder named images in the same directory as your index.html.

Place all your image files inside this images folder.

Consider renaming image1.jpg through image6.jpg to the more descriptive names suggested above (e.g., baserow_interface.jpg, plausible_dashboard.jpg, etc.).

Crucially, if you rename the image files, remember to update the src attribute in your index.html file to match the new names!

This approach makes it much easier to manage your assets and understand your code in the long run.
